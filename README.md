# notebook

A literal Python notebook, like IRL.

⚠️ **At the time of writing, I am still updating the content. In particular, I am making it less focused on geoscience, and converting the fonts.**

The content is provided as SVG files in the `content` directory. You might like to use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to edit these files, or to create PDF files. You can convert a file to PDF on the command line like this:

    inkscape -o test.pdf P01.svg

The pages are 5 inches wide &times; 7 inches high; the files are labelled for a 32-page booklet, but you can have any number of pages, just recalculate the page numbers accordingly.

You should be able to provide the PDF files to a printer to produce the physical notebooks. I highly recommend [Scout Books](https://scoutbooks.com/) they produce high quality output.

### Fonts

The type is the free, open [Noto font](https://fonts.google.com/noto). Please see the Open Font License bundled with them in the `fonts` directory. You will need to place these fonts on your system in order for them to render correctly on your computer (on Linux, this usually means unpacking them into your `~/.fonts` folder).

### Re-use and remix
